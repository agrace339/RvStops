# RV Stops
This app is designed to help RV owners find a RV stop that is along their route, though I am starting small and only doing NH trips, because I cannot find an API for RV parks.

## Audience
This would be useful for NH RV owners who need a place to stop that is not far off their route.

## Experience
The app will allow users to have a efficient way of getting to their destination while finding a place to stay.

# Technical
## Models
google maps and locations nearby, making the most effient route

## Views
A screen with a map or list view that allows the user to input their route. When the user clicks on an RV park (either from an icon or from the list) they will be taken to another screen describing the park and its differnet ammenities
